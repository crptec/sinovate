Go to **Options menu**, (gear icon or Settings > **Options** from drop down menu), and select **Enable coin control** features, now click **OK**

From **Send** now you can see a new button named **Coin control**

This button allows you to open the **Coin Selection window**. You can see all transactions and select some to use.Â 

**Why there is coin control?** To keep Blockchain secured, it must have limits, and some time with many transactions you can face this limit with error [Transaction too large](transaction too high). Coin control helps in this and other issues.
