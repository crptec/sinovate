**SINOVATE (SIN)** is an open-source state of the art digital cryptocurrency. We create and build
innovative blockchain services for individuals, developers, and enterprises. 
Big Data solutions, Deterministic Infinity Nodes, Decentralized Cloud (dCloud),
proof-of-integrity, proof-of-inheritance, and inflation-control are some of the resolutions presented to the crypto space.

# Features and Innovations

 - **X25X GPU Mining Algorithm:** Leading-edge, in-house built, custom GPU mining algorithm. More complex, less power-hungry.
 - **Deterministic Infinity Nodes:** Explicitly designed to overcome the hyperinflation all cryptocurrency projects face. Infinity nodes burn the collateral for  unprecedented network security and stability.
 - **Incorruptible Data Storage:** Incorruptible Data Storage. DataSend, DataStore and Blockchain-mail. Proof-of-Integrity. Unlimited private networking of big data storage.

SINOVATE (SIN) combines its brand new **X25X Proof of Work (PoW)** algorithm with LWMA difficulty retargeting algorithm, Reorg fork reject solution merged with P.O.B., establishes a 51% attack protection.


X25X proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm is GPU mineable and ensures temporary (until optimized) ASIC, FPGA, and QUANTUM resistance, solidifying the decentralized consensus mechanism in the process.
