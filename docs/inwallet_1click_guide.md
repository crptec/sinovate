>  5.

> Do not close wallet till you see "Finished" - SINOVATE setUP is now complete. Depending on block confirmation speed, invoice payment, and the SIN coin burning process will automatically take between 3 and 10 minutes, up to 55 blocks.

Check the transactions History of your wallet and your node will be up and running in less than 10 mins automatically after the confirmations.

  

It really is that simple, just a few clicks, would-be network participants will earn considerable passive income for up to a year. For community members who have previously set up an infinity node, SINOVATE setUP provides the perfect opportunity to reassess your VPS needs at a fraction of the cost.
