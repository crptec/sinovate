**SINOVATE (SIN)** is an open-source state-of-the-art digital cryptocurrency. 
We build innovative blockchain cloud services for individuals, developers, and enterprises. 
Decentralized cloud (dCloud), **SINCORD** messenger, proof-of-integrity, proof-of-inheritance, and blockchain-based file transfer protocol **bFTP** are some solutions for the crypto space.

# Features and Innovations

 - **X25X** GPU Algorithm. Leading-edge, in-house built, custom GPU mining algorithm. More complex, less power-hungry.
 - **Deterministic InfinityNodes** InfinityNodes are custom "burn to run" service nodes for unparalleled network security, speed, scalability and stability.
 - **NEPHELE: Incorruptible Data Storage** Blockchain-mail, Proof-of-Integrity. SINCORD messenger, proof-of-inheritance, blockchain-based file transfer protocol are stored on InfinityNodes for unlimited public or private networking of distributed data storage.

SINOVATE (SIN) combines its brand new **X25X Proof of Work (PoW)** algorithm with LWMA difficulty retargeting algorithm, Reorg fork reject solution merged with proof-of-burn, PoS4 and LockReward for an unbreakable 51% attack protection.
